# Statistics fundamentals

Over the course of my studies and especially my PhD, time and time again it proved necessary to refer back to the very basics of statistics. So here I've made a list of websites and tutorials that I found useful.

## OnlineStatBook

One of the most useful resources has been this [OnlineStatBook][1] developed by Rice University, University of Houston Clear Lake, and Tufts University. 
It has very clear descriptions and insightful visualisations of a wide variety of subjects, including probability theory, means testing, regression, confidence intervals, Chi square tests and effect size calculations.
