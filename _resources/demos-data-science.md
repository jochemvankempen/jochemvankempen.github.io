# Demos

I started making [demos in jupyter notebooks][1]. They work very well as a way to go through statistics/data science techniques in a step-by-step manner. I've added Binder and Google Colab links in the notebooks so it's easy to open them without cloning the repository. Hopefully they are useful!

Here is a non-exhaustive list of the demos I've made:
- [Area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC)](https://github.com/jochemvankempen/demos-data-science/blob/master/signal-detection-AUROC.ipynb)
- [Logistic regression](https://github.com/jochemvankempen/demos-data-science/blob/master/GLM-logistic-regression.ipynb)
- [Maximum likelihood estimation](https://github.com/jochemvankempen/demos-data-science/blob/master/maximum-likelihood-estimation.ipynb)
- [Principal component analysis (PCA)](https://github.com/jochemvankempen/demos-data-science/blob/master/dimensionality-reduction-PCA.ipynb)
- [Recurrent neural network (RNN) in pytorch](https://github.com/jochemvankempen/demos-data-science/blob/master/motor_output_prediction.ipynb)
