# Linear algebra

If you don't have much formal training in maths or programming it can be daunting to start with linear algebra. During my PhD I started several online courses but struggled to build intuitions because, to be honest, many courses are not that great. Here is selection of tutorials, videos and courses that I found incredibly useful. 

## 3Blue1Brown - essence of linear algebra
This [beautiful youtube lecture series by 3Blue1Brown][1] is really insightful and is both a great introduction as well as a refresher. It has beautiful visualisations and individual lectures only take between 5 and 15 minutes to watch. 

## Mike X Cohen - complete linear algebra
When I stumbled across [this Udemy course][2] I was initially reluctant to pay for it. I am, however, really happy that I did. Mike is a great teacher and uses code to make mathematical concepts very insightful.
