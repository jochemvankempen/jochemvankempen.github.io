excerpt: "Building a personal website"

When I started looking into building this website, I came across [a post by peter wills][1] that made it extremely easy for me. He provided a step-by-step guide and insights into his learning process. He even shared all his [code on github][2]. 

So far I have only made a rudimentary copy of his work. I'm still learning, but I will update this post with any additional information that I come across in the future.
